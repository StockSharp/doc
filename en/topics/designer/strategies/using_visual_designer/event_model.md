# Event model

The approach of building schemas in [Designer](../../../designer.md) based on the generation and subsequent processing of events. When building a strategy, it is not known when an event of the market data change will occur, but you can subscribe to this event and process it accordingly.

Each [Designer](../../../designer.md) cube that has an output parameter is the event generator. And cubes having an input parameter can subscribe to the event generated by the outgoing parameter. Subscribing for an event is nothing more than creating a connection line between two cubes.

For example, the [Order book](elements/market_depths/order_book.md) cube generates an order book change event. It is not known in advance when a change will occur. Having created a connection line between the [Order book](elements/market_depths/order_book.md) cube and the [Converter](elements/converters/converter.md) cube, a subscribing is done to the order book change for further processing with the [Converter](elements/converters/converter.md) cube, etc.:
