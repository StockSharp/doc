# Programming Languages

[Designer](../../designer.md) supports three programming languages for creating trading strategies:

- [C#](using_code/csharp.md)
- [F#](using_code/fsharp.md) 
- [Python](using_code/python.md)

## C#

C# is the main language for developing trading strategies. All components, examples and core code are written in C#. C# provides full access to the entire [S#](../../api.md) platform architecture.

## F#

F# is a functional programming language from Microsoft. Trading strategies in F# have full access to all API capabilities and can be used for both testing and live trading.

## Python 

Python integration allows writing trading strategies using the Python programming language, making it easier for Python developers to work with the platform.
