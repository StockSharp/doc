# Running Strategies Outside of Designer

Strategies created in [Designer](../../designer.md) can be run both in your own programs built on the [API](../../api.md) and in the [Runner](../../runner.md) or [Shell](../../shell.md) applications.

- [Runner](../../runner.md) is faster and consumes less memory than [Designer](../../designer.md), so strategies will perform better. This approach is ideal for running strategies on a server. More details can be found in [Export from Designer](../../runner/export_from_designer.md).

- [Shell](../../shell.md) is provided as source code. This approach is ideal for distributing strategies with a unique interface specially created for the strategies. More details can be found in [Running a Strategy Created in Designer](../../shell/run_strategies_from_designer.md).
