# Settings directory

The following directories are important for work with the [Designer](../../designer.md):

1. The directory, where the [Designer](../../designer.md), was installed, from this folder you can launch [Designer](../../designer.md) by running the **Designer.exe** file. Or update Designer, by running the **Designer.Update.exe** file. Deleting this directory will delete Designer, however, the Designer settings will not be deleted.

2. The [Designer](../../designer.md) settings directory is located in the folders of user's documents â€¦\\StockSharp\\Designer\\ (for example, c:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\StockSharp\\Designer\\). Deleting this directory will cause all Designer settings to be reset to the default, **all created strategies and downloaded instruments and other information stored in the settings directory will be DESTROYED.**
