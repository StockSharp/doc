3. Clicking the ![Designer The connection settings 02](../../images/designer_connection_settings_02.png) button activates the drop\-down list of supported connectors. The selected connectors are displayed in the area No. 1. The ![Designer The connection settings 03](../../images/designer_connection_settings_03.png) button removes the selected connector. The first column of the area No. 1 displays whether the connector will connect when you click the Connect ![Designer The connection settings 04](../../images/designer_connection_settings_04.png) button or will not connect ![Designer The connection settings 05](../../images/designer_connection_settings_05.png). These values are set using the ![Designer The connection settings 06](../../images/designer_connection_settings_06.png) and ![Designer The connection settings 07](../../images/designer_connection_settings_07.png) buttons.

The **Market data** and **Trades** fields display whether the connector supports market data and work with orders.
