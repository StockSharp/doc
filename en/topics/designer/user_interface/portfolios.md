The **Portfolios** panel is a table that shows the basic data on the portfolio, and the current positions for these portfolios. By double\-clicking on the portfolio or position, the **Creating portfolio** window or the **Creating position** window appears in which you can edit the selected portfolio or position. To create a new portfolio or a new position, you should click the ![Designer Panel Circuits 01](../../../images/designer_panel_circuits_01.png) button and select the appropriate item in the drop\-down menu.
