The **Statistics** component is a table grouped by categories: Orders, P\/L, Trade positions. Statistics helps to assess the correctness and performance of the strategy. For instance, for the SMA strategy example, there cannot be more than 1 position. Statistics helps to evaluate by other qualitative parameters. For example, the maximum drawdown, the Sharpe coefficient, etc.
