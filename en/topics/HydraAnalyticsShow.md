# Running and displaying results

Below is a sequence of steps to perform data analysis.

### Running the script and displaying the analysis results using the SBER@TQBR security as an example:

For example, we [select the template](HydraAnalyticsScripts.md)**Volume within a day**.

![hydra analitics main 01](../images/hydra_analitics_main_01.png)

1. Select data for analysis:
   - In the **Parameters** window on the right side of program![hydra analitics parameters](../images/hydra_analitics_parameters.png)
   - Specify the instrument, in our case SBER@TQBR. Start and end date, data path and format.
2. Run the script using the ![hydra analitics run](../images/hydra_analitics_run.png) button.
3. Then the processing result will be displayed.![hydra analitics table](../images/hydra_analitics_table.png). 
4. View results:

   By default, the result is generated as a table. To view the received data in the form of charts, you should select one of several options for data output.![hydra analitics main 01](../images/hydra_analitics_main_01.png)

   After that, the selected chart will be plotted based on the analytics process results.![hydra analitics chart](../images/hydra_analitics_chart.png)
