# Logs

To simplify the monitoring of work there is a special **Logs** panel in [S\#.Designer](Designer.md). This panel displays messages from all sources, strategies, connections, [S\#.Designer](Designer.md). The **Logs** panel shows the nesting of the sources as a tree. Each parent vertex contains messages from all nested ones, and so on, down to the lowest level. For strategies, such a hierarchy allows you to see child strategies. To open the **Logs** panel, click the **Logs** button in the **Common** tab or click the **Logs** button on the **Quick access panel**. If there are errors in the **Logs** panel, the ![Designer Panel Logs 00](../images/Designer_Panel_Logs_00.png) icon on the **Quick access panel** will blink.
