# Select source

To add a new market data source, you need to:

- Go to the **Common** tab
- Select **Add**
- Select **Sources**

![hydra source choose](../images/hydra_source_choose.png)

Then a list of sources will appear. The user can select several sources at once. 

![hydra source add](../images/hydra_source_add.png)

You can also create multiple instances of the same source. For example, multiple instances of **Interactive Brokers** that will save downloaded data to different folders.

![hydra two sourse](../images/hydra_two_sourse.png)

In order for the source to start downloading data after clicking the **Start** button, it should be enabled. To do this, select the source icon in the left panel and use the ![hydra source on off](../images/hydra_source_on_off.png) button to switch it on or off. You can perform this operation before or after adding instruments for downloading.

Unnecessary sources can be deleted using the ![hydra delete](../images/hydra_delete.png) button.

Source settings can be changed in the **Properties** panel on the right side.

![hydra setting source button](../images/hydra_setting_source_button.png)

Common settings for all sources can be found in the [Common connection settings](HydraCommonConnectionSettings.md) item.

Each connection has its own characteristics, the link [List of connectors](HydraDataSource.md) provides a list of connectors and their settings.
