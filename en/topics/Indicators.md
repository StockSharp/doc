# Indicators

[S\#](StockSharpAbout.md) provides over 70 technical analysis indicators as standard. This allows not to create the necessary indicators from scratch, but to use finished ones. In addition, you can create your own indicators, taking existing ones as a basis, as shown in the [Custom indicator](IndicatorsCustom.md). section. All the base classes for working with indicators, as well as the indicators themselves, are located in the [StockSharp.Algo.Indicators](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators) namespace. 

### Connecting the indicator to the robot

1. At the very beginning, you need to create an indicator. The indicator is created, just like a regular .NET object:

   ```cs
   var longSma = new SimpleMovingAverage { Length = 80 };
   ```
2. Next, you need to fill it with data. For example, this could be the candle closing price:

   ```cs
   foreach (var candle in candles)
   	longSma.Process(candle);
   ```

   The indicator accepts an [IIndicatorValue](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.IIndicatorValue). at the input. Some of the indicators operate with a prime number, such as [SimpleMovingAverage](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.SimpleMovingAverage). Others require a full candle, such as [MedianPrice](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.MedianPrice). Therefore, input values must be cast to either [DecimalIndicatorValue](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.DecimalIndicatorValue) or [CandleIndicatorValue](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.CandleIndicatorValue). The resulting indicator value works according to the same rules as the input value. 
3. The resulting and the input value of the indicator have the [IIndicatorValue.IsFinal](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.IIndicatorValue.IsFinal), property, which indicates that the value is final and the indicator will not change at a given point in time. For example, the [SimpleMovingAverage](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.SimpleMovingAverage) indicator is generated by the candle closing price, but at the current moment the final candle closing price is unknown and is changing. In this case, the resulting [IIndicatorValue.IsFinal](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.IIndicatorValue.IsFinal) value will be 'false'. If the finished candle is passed to the indicator, then the input and resulting values of [IIndicatorValue.IsFinal](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.IIndicatorValue.IsFinal) will be 'true'.
4. To get the current indicator value, the [GetValue\`\`1](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.IIndicatorValue.GetValue``1) method is used:

   ```cs
   // calculate the new position relative to each other
   var isShortLessThenLong = ShortSma.GetCurrentValue() < LongSma.GetCurrentValue();
   // if there was an intersection
   if (_isShortLessThenLong != isShortLessThenLong)
   {
   	// if short is less than long, then sale, otherwise, purchase.
   	var direction = isShortLessThenLong ? Sides.Sell : Sides.Buy;
   	// register the order
   	var volume = Position == 0 ? Volume : Position.Abs().Min(Volume) * 2;
   	var price = candle.ClosePrice + ((direction == Sides.Buy ? Security.PriceStep : -Security.PriceStep) ?? 1);
       RegisterOrder(this.CreateOrder(direction, price, volume));
   	// remember the current position relative to each other
   	_isShortLessThenLong = isShortLessThenLong;
   }
   ```
5. All indicators have a [BaseIndicator.IsFormed](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.BaseIndicator.IsFormed), property, which indicates whether the indicator is ready for use. For example, the [SimpleMovingAverage](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.SimpleMovingAverage) indicator has a period, and until the indicator processes the number of candles equal to the indicator period, the indicator will be considered not ready for use. And the [BaseIndicator.IsFormed](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.BaseIndicator.IsFormed) property will be 'false'.
