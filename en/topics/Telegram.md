# Telegram Services

For remote management of trading robots (e.g., when they're placed on virtual servers), integration with the popular messaging app Telegram has been implemented.

This integration works with both ready-made programs (such as [Designer](Designer.md)) and your own software developed using the [API](StockSharpAbout.md).

Currently, two services are provided:

- [Alerts](TelegramAlerts.md) - a service for receiving notifications from a trading robot.
- [Control Panel](TelegramControl.md) - a service for controlling trading robots (starting, stopping) via a Telegram bot.
