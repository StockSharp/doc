# Candles generation

[S\#.Data](Hydra.md) allows you to generate candles based on downloaded trades, which can later be exported to [Excel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excel), xml, sql, bin, Json or txt formats (see below). 

This allows you to subsequently use the data in any technical analysis programs (WealthLab, AmiBroker, etc.).

### Candles generation

Candles generation

1. On the **Common** tab, click the **Candles** button, the following window will open:![hydra candles main](../images/hydra_candles_main.png)
2. Further it is necessary: 
   - Select the required candle type from the drop\-down list (all [standard candles](Candles.md) are supported) 
   - oSelect the required **Time Frame**

     As an example, we have selected candles with a Time Frame of 5 min.
   - Select an security (in our case it is SBER@TQBR) and click on the ![hydra find](../images/hydra_find.png) button. 

   After that, candles will be generated based on the data found. For example, for candles of [TimeFrameCandle](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Candles.TimeFrameCandle) type the following will be generated: ![hydra candles tf](../images/hydra_candles_tf.png)

   If you need to build candles of a different type, for example [VolumeCandle](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Candles.VolumeCandle), you need to do the following:
   - Select the candle type. ![hydra candles volume 100](../images/hydra_candles_volume_100.png)
   - Select period, volume.
   - Set the security.
   - Select in **Build From**, for example **Ticks**. Click the ![hydra find](../images/hydra_find.png) button.![hydra candles volume](../images/hydra_candles_volume.png)

   If the market data could not be received from the source, candles can be generated by selecting the data type from which they will be built in the [Build From](HydraUsingDifferentTypesMarketData.md) field.

   For example:
   - Candles with Time Frame 10 min from Ticks. ![hydra candles tf 10](../images/hydra_candles_tf_10.png)
   - You can build candles with a large Time Frame from candles with a smaller one by choosing in **Build From** to build **Smaller Time Frame**. For example, from candles with Time Frame 5 minutes candles with Time Frame 30 minutes![hydra candles tf 01](../images/hydra_candles_tf_01.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > If you select **do not build** in the **Build From** field, then ready\-made candles that were downloaded from the source will be searched for.
3. 3.If you need to graphically view the generated candles, then you need to click on the ![hydra candles](../images/hydra_candles.png) button and after that the chart will open: ![hydra candles tf chart](../images/hydra_candles_tf_chart.png)![hydra candles volume chart](../images/hydra_candles_volume_chart.png)
4. You can add indicators to the chart. To do this, open the context menu by right\-clicking on the chart panel and select the **Indicator** item. In addition, the indicator can be displayed on a separate panel. To do this, add a new panel using the ![hydra add](../images/hydra_add.png) button and also select the required indicator from the context menu.![hydra candles ind chart](../images/hydra_candles_ind_chart.png)
5. The received values can be [exported to the required format](HydraExport.md).
