# Subscriptions

Starting with 5.0 version, [S\#.API](StockSharpAbout.md) offers a new data acquisition model (market and transactional data). The model is based on subscriptions and has advantages over regular subscription requests: 

- Subscriptions are isolated from each other, so you can run an arbitrary number of subscriptions in parallel (with a history request or not). 
- Subscriptions have states that make it possible to understand whether historical data is being received at the moment, or whether the subscription has gone online. 
- Subscriptions have a universal approach, and their code is the same regardless of the requested data types. 

To work with subscriptions, you should use the [Subscription](../api/StockSharp.Algo.Subscription.html) class. Below is an example of subscribing to candles via the new model:

```cs
...
var subscription \= new Subscription(new MarketDataMessage
{
	DataType2 \= DataType.TimeFrame(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)),
	From \= DateTimeOffset.Now.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromDays(30)),
	\/\/ null means make subscriptions goes online after historical data
	To \= null,
}, (SecurityMessage)sec);
\/\/ subscribe to events
\_connector.CandleReceived +\= (sub, candle) \=\>
{
	if (sub \!\= subscription)
		return;
	Console.WriteLine(candle);
};
\_connector.SubscriptionOnline +\= (sub) \=\>
{
	if (sub \!\= subscription)
		return;
	Console.WriteLine("Online");
};
\_connector.SubscriptionFailed +\= (sub, error, isSubscribe) \=\>
{
	if (sub \!\= subscription)
		return;
	Console.WriteLine(error);
};
\/\/ start subscription
\_connector.Subscribe(subscription);
...
			
```

Subscription states:

- [Stopped](../api/StockSharp.Algo.SubscriptionStates.Stopped.html)

   \- the subscription is inactive (stopped or did not start). 
- [Active](../api/StockSharp.Algo.SubscriptionStates.Active.html)

   \- the subscription is active, and it can transfer historical data until it goes online or is completed. 
- [Error](../api/StockSharp.Algo.SubscriptionStates.Error.html)

   \- the subscription is inactive and in an error state. 
- [Finished](../api/StockSharp.Algo.SubscriptionStates.Finished.html)

   \- the subscription has finished its work (all data has been received). 
- [Online](../api/StockSharp.Algo.SubscriptionStates.Online.html)

   \- ï‚·the subscription has gone online and only transfers data in real time.
