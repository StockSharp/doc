You must select the start mode and click **OK**.

After selecting the start mode, the terminal window opens with the default set of components.

Let's go to the connection settings and select the required connection. How to set up the connection is described in the [Connection settings](connection_settings.md) section.

The next step is to connect by clicking the **Connect** ![Designer The quick access toolbar 00](../../images/designer_quick_access_toolbar_00.png) button.

Clicking the **Add** ![Designer Creation tool 00](../../images/designer_creation_tool_00.png) button on the chart panel we add a new chart area. Right clicking the mouse button on the chart area, we add candles to it by the instrument of interest to us. We can add indicators, own trades and orders to the chart. There is also a possibility to register orders from the chart. For more information on how to work with the chart, see the [Chart](user_interface/components/chart.md) section.

In the order book, after clicking the **Settings** ![Designer Schedule 01](../../images/designer_schedule_01.png) button, a panel appears where you can specify the **Instrument** and the **Portfolio** for the trades. Here you can also adjust the order book depth. For more information on how to work with an order book, see the [Order book](user_interface/components/order_book.md) section.

Letâ€™s register the first few orders. Orders can be registered either by clicking the **Buy/Sell** buttons or by clicking the cells in the **Bid/Offer** columns of the order book itself. The order panel displays all your orders. When you right-click an order, you will see a panel that lets you submit a new order, cancel, or change the selected order. For more information on how to work with the order panel, see the [Orders](user_interface/components/orders.md) section.
