# Editing instruments

To edit an instrument (for example, when the instrument was not filled with all the necessary data), double click the instrument or click the ![hydra edit](../images/hydra_edit.png) button to open the window in which to perform the necessary settings: 

Go to the **Securities** window.

![hydra security edit 00](../images/hydra_security_edit_00.png)

Then a window for editing will open..

![hydra security edit](../images/hydra_security_edit.png)

If necessary, you can edit the instrument group. To do this, select an instrument group and click on the ![hydra edit](../images/hydra_edit.png) button. 

![hydra securities edit 00](../images/hydra_securities_edit_00.png)

Then you can edit the group.

![hydra securities edit](../images/hydra_securities_edit.png)

If the selected instrument group has the same values, this field will be filled with this value. If the values are different, then this field will be empty. For example, two instruments are selected with the Price Step value equal to 1, one instrument has a lot size of 10, the other \- 100. Accordingly, the Price Step field will be 1, and the Volume Step field will be empty.
