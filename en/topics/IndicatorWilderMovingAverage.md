# Wilder MA

**Wilder Moving Average (WilderMA)** is a weighted moving average indicator. Like all other moving average indicators, the WMA indicator smoothes market noises and displays market trends more clearly. To achieve the goal, the indicator filters out market fluctuations (noises), averaging the price values of the periods by which it is calculated. At the same time, some additional value (weight) is added to the average prices, as is done when calculating all weighted indicators such as EMA, LWMA and SMMA. 

To use the indicator, you must use the [WilderMovingAverage](../api/StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.WilderMovingAverage.html) class.
