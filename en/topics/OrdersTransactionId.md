# Transaction number

When working with orders the main identifier is [Order.TransactionId](../api/StockSharp.BusinessEntities.Order.TransactionId.html), not [Order.Id](../api/StockSharp.BusinessEntities.Order.Id.html). This is done because the [Order.Id](../api/StockSharp.BusinessEntities.Order.Id.html) generated by the exchange. Because of this, immediately after the execution the [Connector.RegisterOrder](../api/StockSharp.Algo.Connector.RegisterOrder.html) method, for some time the [Order.Id](../api/StockSharp.BusinessEntities.Order.Id.html) can not be initialized. Therefore, at once after the transaction sending, the trading program generates [Order.TransactionId](../api/StockSharp.BusinessEntities.Order.TransactionId.html). 

[Order.TransactionId](../api/StockSharp.BusinessEntities.Order.TransactionId.html) automatically generated by the [IdGenerator](../api/Ecng.Common.IdGenerator.html) class. This is an abstract class that has two standard implementations: 

- [IncrementalIdGenerator](../api/Ecng.Common.IncrementalIdGenerator.html)

   \- installed by default. It increases the number by 1. The initial value set through the 

  [IncrementalIdGenerator.Current](../api/Ecng.Common.IncrementalIdGenerator.Current.html)

  , property, and by default, the value is equal to the number of milliseconds since the start of the day. 
- [MillisecondIdGenerator](../api/Ecng.Common.MillisecondIdGenerator.html)

  . It generates the transaction number, which equal to the number of milliseconds from the time of generator creating.
