Clicking the ![Designer The quick access toolbar 02](../images/Designer_quick_access_toolbar_02.png) button allows changing the program launch mode, interface language or totally reset the [Designer](Designer.md) settings.

When the **Launch mode** is selected, the window, allowing changing the interface language, is opened. The launch mode has options of 32\-bit and 64\-bit, at the launch mode selection the available functionality will be highlighted by the ![Designer Start mode 01](../images/Designer_Start_mode_01.png) icon, for example, in 64\-bit mode some connections (highlighted in the window) may not be available.
