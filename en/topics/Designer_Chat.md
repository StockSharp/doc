- Secret chats provide end\-to\-end encryption, the history of which is not stored on any server, providing anonymity of correspondence.
- Availability of a timer for messages self\-destruction.
- Instant delivery of messages and files.
- Ability to transfer files of any format with the size up to 1.5 Gb.
- The Telegram messenger works on IPhone, Android, WindowsPhone. There are online and desktop versions. There is an ability of synchronization between devices.
- Creation of large chats \- up to 5000 members.

When you first open the **Chat**, an authorization page appears, where you need to enter your phone number and wait for the SMS with the activation code. After authorization, you get a full\-featured **Telegram** messenger directly in the [S\#.Designer](Designer.md).
