# Optimal Tracking

**Optimal Tracking Filter** indicator adjusts fast price changes and is relatively smooth when the price has a side effect. This filter's effect is similar to the Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average. 

To use the indicator, you must use the [OptimalTracking](../api/StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.OptimalTracking.html) class.
