# Adapters chain

To make it easier to create your own connections, the[S\#](../../../api.md) package includes a number of special adapters: 

| Adapter                                                                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Additionally, it sends a [TimeMessage](xref:StockSharp.Messages.TimeMessage) to the connection to simulate ping messages if the [IMessageAdapter.HeartbeatInterval](xref:StockSharp.Messages.IMessageAdapter.HeartbeatInterval) is set.  |

| [LookupTrackingMessageAdapter](xref:StockSharp.Algo.LookupTrackingMessageAdapter)                   | An adapter that monitors subscriptions of the [SecurityLookupMessage](xref:StockSharp.Messages.SecurityLookupMessage) type for which the connection does not send the resulting [SubscriptionFinishedMessage](xref:StockSharp.Messages.SubscriptionFinishedMessage) message. In this case, this adapter independently generates the resulting message after a certain timeout.                                                                                                          |

| [SecurityMappingMessageAdapter](xref:StockSharp.Algo.SecurityMappingMessageAdapter)                 | An adapter that automatically replaces instrument IDs, if they are specified in the [ISecurityMappingStorage](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Storages.ISecurityMappingStorage) storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [SecurityNativeIdMessageAdapter](xref:StockSharp.Algo.SecurityNativeIdMessageAdapter)               | An adapter that automatically replaces instrument IDs, if the adapter works with system instrument codes [IMessageAdapter.IsNativeIdentifiers](xref:StockSharp.Messages.IMessageAdapter.IsNativeIdentifiers).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Duplicate subscriptions are saved and added to outgoing messages that inherit from [ISubscriptionIdMessage](xref:StockSharp.Messages.ISubscriptionIdMessage) via the [ISubscriptionIdMessage.SubscriptionIds](xref:StockSharp.Messages.ISubscriptionIdMessage.SubscriptionIds) property..                                                               |
| [SubscriptionMessageAdapter](xref:StockSharp.Algo.SubscriptionMessageAdapter)                       | Subscription monitoring adapter. Unlike [SubscriptionOnlineMessageAdapter](xref:StockSharp.Algo.SubscriptionOnlineMessageAdapter), adapter redirects duplicate subscriptions further and works not only with online subscriptions, but also with history.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| [StorageMessageAdapter](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Storages.StorageMessageAdapter)                        | An adapter that monitors historical subscriptions and tries to load data from internal storage. If the required data is not available, the subscription is redirected fur                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [StorageMetaInfoMessageAdapter](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Storages.StorageMetaInfoMessageAdapter)        | An adapter trying to load meta data ([SecurityMessage](xref:StockSharp.Messages.SecurityMessage), [BoardMessage](xref:StockSharp.Messages.BoardMessage), [PositionChangeMessage](xref:StockSharp.Messages.PositionChangeMessage)) from internal storage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [CandleBuilderMessageAdapter](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Candles.Compression.CandleBuilderMessageAdapter) | Adapter gluing, building (from ticks or other available data) and loading candles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
