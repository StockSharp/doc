# Other Strategy Examples

Hundreds of strategy samples written in C# and Python are maintained in the [AlgoTrading API folder](https://github.com/StockSharp/AlgoTrading/tree/main/API). This link appears first on the page. All of these strategies are also compatible with the [Designer](../../designer.md).

Additional examples can be found in the [Samples](https://github.com/StockSharp/StockSharp/tree/master/Samples/06_Strategies) folder.
