# Trading algorithms

The [S\#](../api.md) library contains, as well as the system modules, already implemented small trading algorithms to simplify the coding of complex strategies working in the 24x7 format. 

- [Slippage](trading_algorithms/slippage.md) \- the slippage monitoring in algorithms. 
- [Profit\-loss](trading_algorithms/profit_loss.md) \- the profit\-loss monitoring in algorithms. 
- [Position](trading_algorithms/position.md) \- the position monitoring in algorithms. 
- [Latency](trading_algorithms/latency.md) \- the monitoring of orders registration latency in algorithms. 
- [Base algorithms](trading_algorithms/base_algorithms.md) \- base algorithms, on which abovementioned trading algorithms are based. 
- [Equity curve](trading_algorithms/equity_curve.md) \- the equity curve calculation by the [profit\-loss](trading_algorithms/profit_loss.md).
