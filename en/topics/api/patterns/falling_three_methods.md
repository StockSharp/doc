### Interpretation

Falling Three Methods is considered a reliable signal of downtrend continuation:

- The first long black candle shows the strength of the downtrend.
- Three small white candles represent a temporary consolidation or correction, during which buyers were unable to significantly change the trend.
- The fifth long black candle confirms the return of control to sellers and the continuation of the downtrend.
- This pattern can be viewed as a flag or pennant in classical technical analysis.
- Such a sequence of candles indicates that the correction was used to accumulate short positions before continuing the downward movement.

### Trading Strategies

Falling Three Methods provides good opportunities for entering or strengthening short positions:

- Enter a short position at the opening after the fifth candle or when the low of the first candle breaks.
- Place a stop-loss above the high of the correction candles or above the high of the first candle.
- Target profit can be set using a projection equal to the distance from the beginning of the trend to the first candle of the pattern.
- Pay attention to volume - ideally, volume decreases on the three middle candles and significantly increases on the fifth candle.
- Combine with other technical indicators to confirm the signal.
- Consider important support levels below the current price that may affect the development of the movement.
