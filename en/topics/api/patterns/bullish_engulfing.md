### Interpretation

Bullish Engulfing is considered one of the most reliable signals of a downtrend reversal:

- The first candle confirms the existing downtrend and shows control by sellers.
- The second candle demonstrates a sharp transition of control to buyers, who not only reverse the losses of the previous period but also create a significant gain.
- The complete engulfing of the previous candle body symbolizes a complete shift in prevailing sentiment from bearish to bullish.
- The larger the size of the second candle compared to the first, the stronger the signal.
- If the pattern forms at a support level or after a prolonged downtrend, its significance increases.

### Trading Strategies

Bullish Engulfing provides excellent opportunities for entering a long position:

- Enter a long position after the pattern formation, usually at the opening of the next candle.
- Place a stop-loss below the low of the second candle of the pattern.
- Target profit can be set based on previous resistance levels, risk/reward ratio, or using technical indicators.
- High trading volume during the formation of the second candle significantly increases the reliability of the signal.
- Combine with other indicators, such as RSI in the oversold zone or moving average convergence, to increase the probability of a successful trade.
