# Configuration BitStamp

To work with a connector, it is required to generate the **Key (API Key)** and **Secret** in the personal account of the exchange and specify them in the connection settings.

> [!TIP]
> It is worth paying attention that the **Key** and **Secret** are not the **Login** and **Password**. The **Key** and **Secret** are generated separately in your personal account. You do not need the **Login** and **Password** to work with the connector and you do not need to specify them anywhere.
