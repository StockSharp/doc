# Gate.io Connector Settings

To work with the connector, you need to generate an **API Key** and **Secret** in the exchange's personal account and specify them when setting up the connection.

> [!TIP]
> Note that the **API Key and Secret** are not **Login and Password**. **API Key and Secret** are generated separately in the personal account. Login and Password are not required for the connector and should not be specified anywhere.
