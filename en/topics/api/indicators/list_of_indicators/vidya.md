# VIDYA

**Variable Index Dynamic Average (VIDYA)** is an indicator with the original method of calculating the exponential moving average (EMA) with dynamically changing averaging period. The averaging period depends on the market volatility; a momentum oscillator (CMO) was chosen as a volatility measure. 

To use the indicator, you must use the [Vidya](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.Vidya) class.
