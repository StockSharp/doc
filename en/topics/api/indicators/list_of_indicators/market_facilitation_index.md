# Market Facilitation Index

**Market Facilitation Index (MFI)** is an indicator that assesses the market's readiness to move the price. It analyzes the ratio of price changes to volume changes over a certain period of time to measure the market's response to volume changes. It calculates MFI using the formula (High â€” Low) / Volume, providing an understanding of market dynamics.
The absolute values of the indicator cannot provide any trading signals, unlike its dynamics relative to the volume dynamics.

To use the indicator, the [MarketFacilitationIndex](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.MarketFacilitationIndex) class should be used.
