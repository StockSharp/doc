# MACD

**Moving Averages Convergence-Divergence (MACD)** is a momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price.

The indicator is calculated as the difference between a short moving average and a long moving average. By default, the periods for these averages are set to 12 and 26, respectively.

To use the indicator, the [MovingAverageConvergenceDivergence](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.MovingAverageConvergenceDivergence) class should be used.
