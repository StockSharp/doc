# Pattern 3 Inside Down and 3 Inside Up

The terms 3 Inside Down and 3 Inside Up refer to a pair of reversal candlestick patterns (each containing three separate candles), which are displayed on candlestick charts. The pattern requires the formation of three candles in a specific sequence, indicating that the current trend has lost momentum and may be starting to move in the opposite direction.

##### Key Features:

- The 3 Inside Up pattern is a bullish reversal pattern consisting of a large downward candle, a smaller upward candle contained within the previous candle, followed by another upward candle that closes above the second candle's close.
- The 3 Inside Down pattern is a bearish reversal pattern consisting of a large upward candle, a smaller downward candle contained within the previous candle, followed by another downward candle that closes below the second candle's close.

- Consider using these patterns in the context of the overall trend. For example, use 3 Inside Up during a pullback in an overall upward trend.
