# Pattern 3 Outside Down and 3 Outside Up

The terms 3 Outside Down and 3 Outside Up refer to three-candle reversal patterns. For a pattern to form, three candles must form in a specific sequence, indicating that the current trend has lost momentum and may signal a reversal of the existing trend. Specifically, a pattern forms when a bearish candle (which closes lower than it opened) is followed by two instances of a bullish candle (which closes higher than it opened), or vice versa.
