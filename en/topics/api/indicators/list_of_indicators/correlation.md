# Correlation

**Correlation** or **correlational dependence** is a statistical relationship between two or more random variables (or variables that can be considered as such with a certain degree of accuracy), where changes in the values of one or several of these variables accompany systematic changes in the values of another or others.

The mathematical measure of the correlation between two random variables is the correlation ratio or correlation coefficient. It characterizes the strength of the relationship between variables.

Correlation Coefficient
1. Can take values from -1 to +1.
2. The sign of the coefficient indicates the direction of the relationship (direct or inverse).
3. The absolute value indicates the strength of the relationship.
4. Always based on pairs of numbers.
