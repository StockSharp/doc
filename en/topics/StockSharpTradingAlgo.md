# Trading algorithms

The [S\#](StockSharpAbout.md) library contains, as well as the system modules, already implemented small trading algorithms to simplify the coding of complex strategies working in the 24x7 format. 

- [Slippage](Slippage.md) \- the slippage monitoring in algorithms. 
- [Profit\-loss](PnL.md) \- the profit\-loss monitoring in algorithms. 
- [Position](Position.md) \- the position monitoring in algorithms. 
- [Latency](Latency.md) \- the monitoring of orders registration latency in algorithms. 
- [Base algorithms](BasicAlgo.md) \- base algorithms, on which abovementioned trading algorithms are based. 
- [Order book: sparse and grouped](SparseDepth.md) \- order book changing to sparse and, vice versa, the grouping by price levels. 
- [Equity curve](Equity.md) \- the equity curve calculation by the [profit\-loss](PnL.md).
