# Backup

The [S\#](StockSharpAbout.md) provides functionality for backup of downloaded data to the [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) cloud storage.

For backup purposes, it is required to create and configure an account at AWS, and then to create and configure the "Backup task".
