# DPO

**Detrended Price Oscillator (DPO)** is an oscillator that discards price trends, trying to estimate the duration of price cycles from peak to peak or from trough to trough. DPO is not a momentum indicator, unlike other oscillators, such as the convergence of a stochastic or moving average (MACD). It identifies peaks and troughs in the price, which are used to evaluate entry and exit points. 

To use the indicator, you must use the [DetrendedPriceOscillator](../api/StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.DetrendedPriceOscillator.html) class.
