# Symbol mapping

The same instrument in different trading systems can be called differently. In **Designer**, it is possible to match the instrument and the connections through which this instrument will be traded, and indicate how it is identified in the external trading system. This is useful when trading one instrument on different trading boards or through different connections (or brokers). Also, it allows receiving data from one connection and making trades through another connection.

To match securities and connections click the **Securities and connections** in the All securities panel.
