# Bollinger Bands

**Bollinger Bands** is an oscillating indicator that is used to measure market volatility. It allows to assess whether the price is high or low compared to the moving average. The central band corresponds to a simple moving average price. The upper and lower bands are the levels at which the price can be considered high or low relative to the moving average. 

To use the indicator, you must use the [BollingerBands](xref:StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.BollingerBands) class.
