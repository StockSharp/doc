# UO

**Ultimate Oscillator (UO)** is a technical indicator developed by Larry Williams in 1976 to measure a momentum across multiple timeframes. Using a weighted average for three different timeframes, the indicator has less volatility and less trading signals compared to other indicators that rely on a single timeframe. 

To use the indicator, you must use the [UltimateOscillator](../api/StockSharp.Algo.Indicators.UltimateOscillator.html) class.
