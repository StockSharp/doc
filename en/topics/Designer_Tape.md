# Ribbon

The main user interface element of [Designer](Designer.md) is the **Ribbon**, which runs along the top of the application window. The ribbon allows for quick access to necessary commands. Commands are organized into logical groups, collected on tabs. To navigate to the desired tab, simply click on its title (name). Each tab is associated with the type of action being performed.

1. The **Common** tab, which opens by default after starting, contains elements that may be needed at the initial stage of work. From the **Common** tab, you can open [Connection Settings](Designer_Connection_settings.md), [Configure Startup Mode](Designer_Start_mode.md), [Schemes Panel](Designer_Panel_Schemas.md), [Logs Panel](Designer_Panel_Logs.md), [Portfolios](Designer_Panel_Portfolios.md), [Board Editor](Designer_Boards.md), [Create a Historical Data Repository](Designer_Creating_repository_of_historical_data.md). Also, on the **Common** tab, you can add, open, delete, import, and export strategies. If you want to share your strategy with the community, you can do so by clicking the *Publish* button. The adjacent button - *Available Strategies*, opens algorithms published by you and other users. On the right, there are service buttons for calling help, as well as for contacting us. You can report a problem or write to us in Telegram chat.

2. The **Backtest** tab automatically opens when selecting a strategy on the [Schemes](Designer_Panel_Schemas.md) panel. The **Backtest** tab contains the main elements for creating, debugging, testing, and optimizing strategies ([Creating a Strategy](Designer_Creating_strategy_out_of_blocks.md), [Example of Backtesting](Designer_Example_of_backtesting.md)). Also, on this tab, the strategy is launched for real trading, and necessary components for your strategy are selected: chart, order book, trades, etc.
