# Ribbon

The main element of the [S\#.Designer](Designer.md) user interface is a **Ribbon** that is located along the top of the application window. Using the ribbon, you can quickly find the necessary commands. The commands are arranged in logical groups, collected on tabs. To go to the required tab, just click its name. Each tab is associated with the type of action being performed.

1. The **Common** tab, which is opened by default after startup, contains the elements that you might need at the beginning of the work. In the **Common** tab, you can open [Schemas](Designer_Panel_Schemas.md), [Logs](Designer_Panel_Logs.md), [Portfolios](Designer_Panel_Portfolios.md), [Getting started](Designer_Creating_repository_of_historical_data.md), [Strategy gallery](Designer_Gallery_of_strategies.md), [Strategies dashboard](Designer_Panel_strategies.md), [Optimization](Designer_Optimization.md). Also in the **Common** tab, you can select the Theme of [S\#.Designer](Designer.md).
