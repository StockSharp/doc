## Store

The **Store** is our marketplace and showcase for products created by the company and the community. It helps developers promote their work and makes it easy for users to discover, download, and update extensions for the platform.

### Uploading content

Anyone can publish their own robot, trading strategy, or indicator. Publication is performed through the [Installer](installer.md):

1. Prepare the package with your project files.
2. Open the Installer and sign in.
3. Choose **Publish** and follow the step-by-step wizard to upload the package, description, and screenshots.
4. Decide whether the item will be free or specify a price.

After submission the material is reviewed by our team. Once approved it becomes available in the Store catalogue.

### Monetization and commission

Authors can distribute their work for free or sell it. Payments are processed by the company, which retains a commission from each sale. To learn the current commission rate and payout terms, please contact us at info@stocksharp.com.
