# Create new source

To add your own source, you need to create your own [IMessageAdapter](xref:StockSharp.Messages.IMessageAdapter). How to do this, see [Creating own connector](../api/connectors/creating_own_connector.md). After creating, you need to add the resulting dll file to the folder with [Hydra](../hydra.md).
