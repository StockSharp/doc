# Editing instruments

To edit an instrument (for example, if it was created without all required data), double-click the instrument or click the ![hydra edit](../../../images/hydra_edit.png) button to open the window where you can make the necessary changes:

Go to the **Securities** window.

![hydra security edit 00](../../../images/hydra_security_edit_00.png)

The editing window will open.

![hydra security edit](../../../images/hydra_security_edit.png)

If necessary, you can edit the instrument group. Select an instrument group and click the ![hydra edit](../../../images/hydra_edit.png) button.

![hydra securities edit 00](../../../images/hydra_securities_edit_00.png)

Then edit the group as needed.

If all selected instruments have the same value in a field, that value will be displayed. If the values differ, the field will be empty. For example, if two instruments have a Price Step of 1 but one has a lot size of 10 and the other 100, the Price Step field will show 1, and the Volume Step field will be empty.
