# Chart

The **Chart** component contains all the **Chart panel** cubes that are in the strategy. For example, if the strategy uses two **Chart panel** cubes, then in the **Chart** component 2 charts are displayed, as in the figure.

The top left corner of each chart shows all the graphical elements added to the chart. If you clear the check box on the ![Designer Schedule 00](../images/Designer_Schedule_00.png) graphic element, the element will be removed from the chart. Click on the ![Designer Schedule 01](../images/Designer_Schedule_01.png) button will open the settings for the graphic element. Also, you can set up the graphic element in the [Chart](Designer_Panel_graphics.md) cube properties.
