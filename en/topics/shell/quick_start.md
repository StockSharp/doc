# Quick start

[Shell](../shell.md) \- \- is focused on programming in [C\#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) language in Visual Studio environment or similar.

When you start the [Shell](../shell.md) project, the Solution Explorer displays the Shell project:

![Shell Quick start 00](../../images/shell_quick_start_00.png)

The **Strategies** folder contains three strategies included in [Shell](../shell.md), a shell for default strategies, as well as some auxiliary interfaces.

The project can be launched without any preliminary preparation to see how it operates on the strategies already included in [Shell](../shell.md).

After launch, we will see a window like this:

The connection settings and connection buttons, as well as the save button for the current Shell configuration, are located at the top of the screen. The main tabs are also located there.

Go to the connection settings and select the necessary connection. How to set up a connection is described in [Connections settings](connections_settings.md).

The next step is to connect by clicking the **Connect** button ![Designer The quick access toolbar 00](../../images/designer_quick_access_toolbar_00.png).

After connecting, on the [Common](user_interface/common.md) tab, you can see the portfolios, securities, orders, and own trades received from the connection.

Go to the Real\-time tab and click the **Add** ![Designer Creation tool 00](../../images/designer_creation_tool_00.png) button to add a strategy for trading.

Once the strategy is added, fill in its basic parameters such as **Security**, **Portfolio**, etc. Click the Start strategy button to launch it.

Similar to the [Real\-time](user_interface/real_time.md) tab, you can run a strategy test on historical data on the [Emulation](user_interface/emulation.md) tab.
