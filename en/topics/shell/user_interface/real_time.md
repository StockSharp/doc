By clicking the **Add** ![Designer Creation tool 00](../../../images/designer_creation_tool_00.png) button, you can add a strategy to start trading. Each added strategy is opened on a separate tab and added to the list of strategies on the **Strategies** tab.

On the **Strategies** tab, you can delete, start, stop, and configure strategies. The same can be done on an individual strategy tab. The individual strategy tab has more extensive information on the strategy, statistics, a list of registered orders and trades of the strategy, etc.
