By clicking the **Add** ![Designer Creation tool 00](../../../images/designer_creation_tool_00.png) button, you can add a strategy for testing. Each added strategy is opened on an individual tab.

An individual strategy tab has extensive information about the strategy, statistics, a list of registered orders and trades of the strategy, etc. On this tab, you can configure testing parameters, the path to historical data, the start and end dates of testing, and the format of the historical data storage.
