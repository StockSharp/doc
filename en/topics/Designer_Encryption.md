# Export with encryption

You can set up encryption in the **Export scheme** window ([Export](Designer_Export_strategies.md)).

If you open an xml file after encryption, you can see that the schema description is not readable:

When importing an encrypted file, you should enter the password that was entered when the file was encrypted.
