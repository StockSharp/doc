# Risk management

In the [Backtesting settings](Designer_Properties_emulation.md) and [Live settings](Designer_Properties_Live.md) panels, you can set the risk control settings.

In the Risk window, you should select the **Risk\-rule**, configure the trigger condition for the **Risk\-rule** and the action (Close positions, Stop trading, Cancel orders), which will be executed when the **Risk\-rule** condition is triggered.
