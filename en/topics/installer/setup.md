# First Run

1. To install [Installer](../installer.md), go to the [Download](https://stocksharp.com/products/download/) page:
   
    ![Installer installation](../../images/installer_installation.png)

2. Download the [Installer](../installer.md) distribution.
3. Run the installation file **stocksharp_setup.exe** and follow the installer instructions.
4. Sometimes, Windows does not start the installation immediately and displays a warning:

   ![Installerzip Properties](../../images/installer_warn_1.png)

5. In this case, click on the **More info** link in the warning window, after which the following window will appear:

    ![Installerzip Properties](../../images/installer_warn_2.png)

    Clicking the **Run anyway** button starts the installation of [Installer](../installer.md).

6. [Installer](../installer.md) will then unpack. Wait for the process to complete.
7. During the first launch you need to enter your **StockSharp** login and password.

    ![log In installer](../../images/login_installer.png)

    You can sign in either by entering your credentials directly or via social network authorization. If you registered on the StockSharp website through a social network, you will not have a password.

8. After logging in, the program window will open:
![first win installer](../../images/first_win_installer.png)
