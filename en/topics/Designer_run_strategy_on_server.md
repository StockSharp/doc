# Run strategy on server

Strategies created in [Designer](Designer.md), can be run in [Shell](Shell.md). [Shell](Shell.md) is faster and uses less memory than [Designer](Designer.md), and so strategies will have better performance. This approach is ideal for hosting strategies on a server.

[Shell](Shell.md) can act as a container server for different types of strategies, including those created in [Designer](Designer.md).

To run the strategy in [Shell](Shell.md) you need to export the strategy to a file as described in [Export](Designer_Export_strategies.md) or [Export with encryption](Designer_Encryption.md) with encryption and load it into [Shell](Shell.md) as described in [Run strategies from Designer](Shell_run_Designer_strategy.md).
