# Export to Runner and Shell

Strategies created in Designer can be launched using the Runner or Shell programs.

- Runner is faster and uses less memory than Designer, thus strategies will perform better. This approach is ideal for running strategies on a server. For more details, see [Export from Designer](RunnerDesignerExport.md).

- Shell is provided as source code. This approach is ideal for distributing strategies with a unique interface, specifically designed for the strategies. For more details, see [Running a strategy created in Designer](Shell_run_Designer_strategy.md).
