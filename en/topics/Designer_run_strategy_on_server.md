# Running Strategies Outside of Designer

Strategies created in [Designer](Designer.md) can be run both in your own programs built on the [API](StockSharpAbout.md) and in the [Runner](Runner.md) or [Shell](Shell.md) applications.

- [Runner](Runner.md) is faster and consumes less memory than [Designer](Designer.md), so strategies will perform better. This approach is ideal for running strategies on a server. More details can be found in [Export from Designer](RunnerDesignerExport.md).

- [Shell](Shell.md) is provided as source codes. This approach is ideal for distributing strategies with a unique interface specially created for the strategies. More details can be found in [Running a Strategy Created in Designer](Shell_run_Designer_strategy.md).
