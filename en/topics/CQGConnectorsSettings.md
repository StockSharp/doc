# Configuration CQG

There are two ways to work with the **CQG** connector:

1. **CQG COM**, connection through the local **CQG Integrated Client**, which is installed directly on the computer from which the connection will be made. **CQG Integrated Client** can be downloaded [on the developer's site.](http://www.cqg.com/products/cqg-integrated-client) To connect to the **CQG Integrated Client**, you have to specify the **Login** and **Password**. 

2. **CQG Continuum**, connection directly to the server, to connect you have to specify the **Login**, **Password** and **server address**.

**Login**, **Password** and **server address** are provided by the broker. To get the API access it is recommended to contact the broker.
